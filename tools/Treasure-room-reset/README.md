# Treasure Room Reset

This program is intended to fix the common treasure room softlock (untested) by resetting your treasure room and giving you the keys back

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- A GD Save File

## How To Use

Just copy and paste your `CCGameManager.dat` into the directory with `run.bat` and then run `run.bat` it should create a new folder which has a new save with the treasure room reset

### IMPORTANT

Make sure that you backup you CCGameManager file beforehand and be sure to remove CCGameManager2.dat too so the game doesn't load that file
