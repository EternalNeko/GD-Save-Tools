# GD Gauntlet Softlock Fix
 corrects all the flags in your save data for gauntlets

## Requirements

The only requirement you will need to get this running is [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## How to Use?

- go to `C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\GeometryDash` and copy the `CCGameManager.dat` file and paste it with `run.bat`

- run `run.bat`

- go to the `build` directory and copy the `CCGameManager.dat` from there and return to `C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\GeometryDash`.

- replace the old `CCGameManager.dat` with the fixed one (dont forget to backup in case of any mistakes) and delete `CCGameManager2.dat`

open Geometry dash and then it *should* be fixed
